            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 cup bread flour</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
                <li>1/2 cup warm water</li>
                <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, plus extra to coat bowl</li>
                <li>1 cup bread flour, or more as needed</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Place 1/2 cup flour, yeast, and sugar in a mixing bowl.  Pour in warm water.  Whisk</p>
                    <p>together thoroughly,2 to 3 minutes.  Cover bowl and let sit until mixture gets bubbly,</p>
                    <p>30 to 60 minutes.  Drizzle in olive oil; add salt and 1 cup flour.  Mix together until</p>
                    <p>mixture forms a sticky dough ball that pulls away from the sides of the bowl.</p>
                    <p>If mixture seems too wet, add a bit more flour.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Lightly flour a work surface.  Knead dough until it is soft, supple, and slightly elastic</p>
                    <p>about 2 minutes.  Pour a few drops of olive oil in the bowl.  Transfer dough ball to bowl</p>
                    <p>and turn to coat surface with oil.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Cover bowl and place in a warm spot.  let dough rise until it has doubled in size, 60 to</p>
                    <p>90 minutes.  Transfer dough to work surface and knead to remove air bubbles, about 1</p>
                    <p>minute.  Transfer to zip top plastic bag; refrigerate 8 hours or overnight.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>lightly flour a work surface; dough may be sticky so make sure you use enough flour</p>
                    <p>to keep dough from sticking to the surface or your hands.  Break</p>
                    <p>off a piece of dough slightly smaller than a golf ball.  roll into a smoothh ball.  Flatten</p>
                    <p>and roll out into a circle about 1/8-inch thick</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Heat a cast iron skillet over high heat. Flour your hands and carefully remove dough.</p>
                    <p>Transfer to hot skillet.  cookuntil blisters form and cover, using dish</p>
                    <p>inverted over it to allow bread to steam and stay moist and supple.</p>
